This repository contains 4 coding challenges.

---

# 1: Array Max Result 
Given an array and target number, return the sum of the target number based on the occurances of that 
number in the array.

Example:

input - [6, 4, 4, 1, 3], 4
output - 8

The 5 numbers in the array are created by user input. The user should be asked to enter 5 numbers
between 1-10.


# 2: Leap Year Calculator

Given a year, output whether is it a leap year or not.

On the Gregorian calendar, a leap year occurs:

* On every year that is evenly divisible by 4 
* except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
* unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

Do not worry about edge cases.

# 3: Perfect Sequence

Given an array, return 'Yes' if the sequence is 'perfect'. Otherwise, return 'No'. 

A perfect sequence is:

* Non negative numbers
* The product and sum of all numbers are equal

# 4: Sum of Rows

Given a matrix of numbers, return the sum of each row in a single dimensional array. 

Example:

input - int[,] myArray = new int[3, 5] { { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, { 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 }, { 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 } };
output - {15,40,65}
